	Jonah Lozano
		Role: Former Team Leader, Currently just a team member

		Project Contributions:
			-Created our first project plan document which assigned parts of the game to
				each team member.
			-After our fourth member dropped the class, he created the second project plan document
				which reassigned parts of the game to the reamaining group members.
				This document would be used to by Ricardo and Tien to work on the game after
					Jonah was absent from the class.
			-Created the GitHub repository for our project.
		
		Source Code Contributions:
			-Jonah created a level loader and multi-key functionality class for his
				Midterm, however the Codebreakers team was unable to obtain these source code files.
			-Therefore, Ricardo and Tien created a game without these source code files.
			-At this point in time Jonah has no source code contributions that are a part of the current game version.
